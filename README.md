# Deep Images Hub

This project create a platform to automatically verifying, preprocessing,and orangize users streaming images and allow user to train image models on demand.

#### Motivation

The demands for machine learning on mobile devices are getting higher and higher especially for computer vision applications. Image classification and object detection algorithms are getting more mature and efficient to run on mobile devices with expected accuracy (ex. MobileNet V2). Companies like Google and Apple are rolling out DL/ML frameworks like Tensorflow Mobile and CoreML. However, there are still a gap to meet the needs from end users. There are not sufficient datasets that are dedicated for mobile image classification, and models that meets userâ€™s specific needs. Image Trainer is a solution to attempt to solve this problem by creating a pipeline to allow users to label and upload mobile captured images to the cloud to automatically feed to train image classification and object detection models.

#### Problems to be Solved

Where are the Datasets? 
Do we have enough models to meet the demands from consumers?
Are we effective enough to train our model for specific needs / domains ?

Real-world deep learning applications are complex big data pipelines, which require a lot of data processing (such as cleaning, transformation, augmentation, feature extraction, etc.) beyond model training/inference. Therefore, it is much simpler and more efficient (for development and workflow management) to seamlessly integrate deep learning functionalities into existing big data workflow running on the same infrastructure, especially given the recent improvements that reduce deep learning training time from weeks to hours or even minutes.

Deep learning is increasingly adopted by the big data and data science community. Unfortunately, mainstream data engineers and data scientists are usually not deep learning experts; as the usages of deep learning expand and scale to larger deployment, it will be much more easier if these users can continue the use of familiar software tools and programming models (e.g., Spark or even SQL) and existing big data cluster infrastructures to build their deep learning applications.
